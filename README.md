## 📊 Coffee & Caffeine Consumption – Data Analytics Capstone Project

This project explores the impact of caffeine consumption across various health, demographic, and economic dimensions using publicly available datasets from NHANES (U.S. health and nutrition data) and FAOSTAT (global food supply data).

---

### 🔍 Key Questions Explored
- 📈 What is the relationship between BMI and caffeine intake?
- 💰 Do income or education levels influence coffee consumption?
- 🏡 Is caffeine consumption significantly different in rural vs. urban populations?
- 🌍 How does U.S. caffeine intake compare with global coffee supply patterns?

### 📌 Project Goals
- Analyze trends in caffeine intake across different demographic groups.
- Integrate global supply data with U.S. dietary intake to identify consumption gaps.
- Build interactive dashboards to communicate findings.

---

### 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Caffeine intake by age group and gender
- Global coffee supply per capita
- U.S. trends over time compared with international averages

---

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Extend analysis to include other caffeine sources (e.g., tea, energy drinks)
- Explore potential links with cardiovascular or sleep-related health outcomes
